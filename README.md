# what2whip
What2Whip is a web application that allows users to input a list of ingredients they have at home, and in return, it generates a set of creative and easy-to-follow recipes using those ingredients. It leverages OpenAI for generating the recipes, Supabase for managing user data and favorites, and integrates React with Bootstrap for the frontend.
